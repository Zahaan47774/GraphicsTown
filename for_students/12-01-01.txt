1. Please give attribution for your environment map image INCLUDING any conversion process you did.

Took the image from the website below that provides skybox images for each side

2. Please explain what you were trying to make with your bump/normal map, and whether it is a bump or normal map.
I created a bump map using an image of dots and an environment map which is completely shiny that allows it to act as a mirror.
