My town's theme is - I wanted to create a miniature model of a city with surrounding suburbs at the border, a downtown with office buildings and attractions in between them such as the carnivals and theatres. A network of road connects the different parts of the town. A car serves as transpotation and a truck delivers packages to the suburban houses. A church forms the center of the city and is located at the juncture of four roads.
